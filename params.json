Currently only the initial resolution can be set and the needed components can be loaded.\r\n\r\n##Predefined Components\r\nThere will be a set of predefined components\r\n* Passive.Hub\r\n* Active.Servo\r\n* Active.Motor\r\n* Active.Linear\r\n* Active.Light\r\n* Sensor.Light\r\n* Sensor.Distance\r\n* Morph.Negator\r\n* Morph.Average\r\n* Morph.Trigger\r\n\r\n##Components\r\nEvery component specifies its connect faces, event handler and shape. A component consist of parts and every part do have plugs (connecting faces).\r\n\r\n### Part\r\nA part do have plugs, which define the connectiong faces for the component. The first part is the parent of the others. only the first part can be used to plug into an existing robot.\r\nParts can be connected fix or with a joint. You can apply force and velocity to a joint or just set a given position which the join should hold.\r\n\r\n### Plug\r\nA plug defines the coordinate of the pluggable faces of a component.\r\n\r\n##Custom Components\r\nIt is possible to implement own components as a shared C++ library as all existing components are as well shared libraries. All used components must be specified in the Resource/synthetics.conf. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
