Currently only the initial resolution can be set and the needed components can be loaded.\r\n\r\n##Components\r\nEvery component specifies its connect faces, event handler and shape.\r\n\r\n##Predefined Components\r\n* Passive.Hub\r\n* Actor.Motor\r\n* Actor.Servo\r\n* Sensor.Light\r\n* Sensor.Distance\r\n* Morph.Negator\r\n* Morph.Average\r\n\r\n##Custom Components\r\nIt is possible to implement own components as a shared C++ library as all existing components are as well shared libraries. All used components must be specified in the Resource/synthetics.conf. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
