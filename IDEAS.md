# IDEAS!!!
## Nameings
* Synthetics (current working name)
* RobotThings
* rThings
* ArtificalThings

## Interacting with your robot
* Combine your pc cameras input with a sensor to interact with our robot, like in real world :) 
  For example you can use real lamp and point to camera which is linked with a simulated light sensor.
  (Idea from Marc Liesch)
* Or combine a arduino with the virtual robot to test various sensors from outside world, like you would do with a real robot (touch sensors, point ligth, ...).

## General
* Real life blocks with stuff from ali express and some nano arduinos.

## Features
* Loudspeaker would be cool, expecialy with the positional sound feature in polycode. *DONE*
* If it is possible to implement a microfon as a sensor? *OPEN*
* Add elastic blocks.
