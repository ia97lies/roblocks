## Nameings
* Synthetics (current working name)
* RobotThings
* rThings

## Interacting with your robot
* Combine your pc cameras input with a sensor to interact with our robot, like in real world :) 
  For example you can use real lamp and point to camera which is linked with a simulated light sensor. Or do the opposide.
  (Idea from Marc Liesch)

* Or combine a arduino with the virtual robot to test various sensors from outside world, like you would do with a real robot (touch sensors, point ligth, ...).

## Features
* Loudspeaker would be cool, expecialy with the positional sound feature in polycode. If it is possible to implement a microfon as a sensor?
