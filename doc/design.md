# Design

## Precondition
* A build Polycode

## Goal
Have a small set of shapes (mostly blocks) and make them easily plugable like lego bricks.
The blocks are hub like elements which build up a communication bus between all components.

## Namespace
::ch::game::synthetics

## Simulation
The blocks which are plugged do need as well simulation and visualization as well (colouring and the like).
There is not only physic simulation but also sensor simulation and its propagation to the actors.
